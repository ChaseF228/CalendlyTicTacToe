My automation tests are written in Ruby using selenium-webdriver to control the browsers.

4 tests: 
- Verify game board appears
- Win a game and verify the winner prompt
- Verify a 5x5 game board appears
- Verify the game board appears on Microsoft Edge

If attempting to set this up in RubyMine, make sure to have all the correct gems installed especialy `selenium-webdriver`.
